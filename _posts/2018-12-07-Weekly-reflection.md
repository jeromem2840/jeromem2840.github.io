#Part 1-My Flag
My flag is the cuban flag the dimentions are 8 by 10 inches this means that the stripes on it will be 1/2 but most of the flag will be taken up by the triangle layer which is 2/4 and just put a star and the cuban flag is complete instead of some minor details
#Part 2-Questions and challenges-Some questions I had were mostly about what size i should make the flag mostly because I was completely lost at first Some Challenges this week gave me was cutting out peices of paper just perfect enough because I wanted to make the best flag possible That was really hard for me this week because I wanted to make the flag the correct colors also but we never had the best pieces of paper and it was a real challenge measuring and cutting the paper and colors that are important to the flag the corect colors are very important to the heritage of the place it's from Those were the real challenges but it was super fun to do some hands on time just doing a Collage.
