Our learning 
This week we learned how to program shapes and color backgrounds in the weschme programming language.One of our tasks was to program a flag of any place in the world with the skills we learned 
I Chose to do japan and i had a bit of trouble with the specific ways the language works, but through collaboration form peers it became easy for the lot of us 
My Learning 
I Learned personally was more about HTml and how the language works once you get more deep into it the language gets more complex in the way you have to type to make the fuctions work. Mr Allata has really shown me alot and i wish to learn more.
