This week we learend a lot about fuctions and expressions and also defintions basicly dinfing a fuction like gt for example you can alter one thing and still produce the same thing just with that one thing altered so you can produce the same image like a green triangle just at a diffrent size but first you need to know how that fuction is made and the contract you need to make to make the function work we are still hard at work trying to make those video games and we are super close to haveing all the tools to make those games work, and be apart of our own creativity.
