I would say that the most important thintg we learned this week was what a model is and some more stuff about functions and images. First models,models are a way to see how something will change or how something will happpen to a specific object or thing and using the little information we were given we came up with a list of ways to make a model, some suggested function and images others suggested real models to use but using what we know about programming and computer science in general we can make those models but not yet we stil are working on making a green triangle but soon i know we will be able to program how a rocket will take off. ```;gt:Number->image``` That is the most advanced function i know at this point but still a green triangle is great in its own right
