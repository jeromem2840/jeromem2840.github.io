This week was all about learning about fuctions and contracts and programmming more on our games. We identifyed what a contract is a contact is what two function are to together We also learned more about functions mostly about define and bitmap.url.
Define makes it so that you can make a image to apear by typing the diffnition into the image space like a face or an background images bitmap.url makes it so that a image acually apears so you put an url to an image you want to use but it has to end in .jpeg .gif .png but its not that hard to do difine and bitmap.url have to be in the same space
