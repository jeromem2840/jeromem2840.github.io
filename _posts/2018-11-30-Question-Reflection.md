On the titular question question 8 on the midterm the correct answser was a and 52.8% of us got it correct The question was asking us to expain what completes a expression and it gave us the expression (rotate(*3 10) (big-star 26) and the correct answer was a purple because a color for the expresssion completed it i thing that most people who got it wrong because of people picking the star that was another option they thought it was the part that was missing instead of the color of the star already so that is why A is the correct anwser
